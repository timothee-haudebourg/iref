This crates provides an implementation of
[Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs, aka URLs)][uri] and [Internationalized
Resource Identifiers (IRIs)][iri] following [RFC 3987][uri-rfc] and [RFC
3986][iri-rfc] defined by the [Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF)][ietf] to uniquely identify objects across the web. IRIs are a
superclass of URIs accepting international characters defined in the
[Unicode][unicode] table.

[uri]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier>
[uri-rfc]: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>
[iri]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_resource_identifier>
[iri-rfc]: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987>
[ietf]: <ietf.org>
[unicode]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode>

URI/IRIs are defined as a sequence of characters with distinguishable
components: a scheme, an authority, a path, a query and a fragment.

```text
    foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
    \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
     |           |            |            |        |
  scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
```

This crate provides types to represent borrowed and owned URIs and IRIs
(`Uri`, `Iri`, `UriBuf`, `IriBuf`), borrowed and owned URIs and IRIs
references (`UriRef`, `IriRef`, `UriRefBuf`, `IriRefBuf`) and similar
types for every part of an URI/IRI. Theses allows the easy access and
manipulation of every components.
It features:
  - borrowed and owned URI/IRIs and URI/IRI-reference;
  - mutable URI/IRI buffers (in-place);
  - path normalization;
  - comparison modulo normalization;
  - URI/IRI-reference resolution;
  - static URI/IRI parsing with the [`static-iref`] crate and its `iri`
    macro; and
  - `serde` support (by enabling the `serde` feature).

[`static-iref`]: https://crates.io/crates/static-iref

### Basic usage

You can parse IRI strings by wrapping an `Iri` instance around a `str` slice.
Note that no memory allocation occurs using `Iri`, it only borrows the input data.
Access to each component is done in constant time.

```rust
use iref::Iri;

let iri = Iri::new("https://www.rust-lang.org/foo/bar?query#frag")?;

println!("scheme: {}", iri.scheme());
println!("authority: {}", iri.authority().unwrap());
println!("path: {}", iri.path());
println!("query: {}", iri.query().unwrap());
println!("fragment: {}", iri.fragment().unwrap());
```

IRIs can be created and modified using the `IriBuf` type.
With this type, the IRI is held in a single buffer,
modified in-place to reduce memory allocation and optimize memory accesses.
This also allows the conversion from `IriBuf` into `Iri`.

```rust
use iref::IriBuf;

let mut iri = IriBuf::new("https://www.rust-lang.org".to_string())?;

iri.authority_mut().unwrap().set_port(Some("40".try_into()?));
iri.set_path("/foo".try_into()?);
iri.path_mut().push("bar".try_into()?);
iri.set_query(Some("query".try_into()?));
iri.set_fragment(Some("fragment".try_into()?));

assert_eq!(iri, "https://www.rust-lang.org:40/foo/bar?query#fragment");
```

The `try_into` method is used to ensure that each string is syntactically correct with regard to its corresponding component (for instance, it is not possible to replace `"query"` with `"query?"` since `?` is not a valid query character).

### Detailed Usage

#### Path manipulation

The IRI path is accessed through the `path` or `path_mut` methods.
It is possible to access the segments of a path using the iterator returned by the `segments` method.

```rust
for segment in iri.path().segments() {
  println!("{}", segment);
}
```

One can use the `normalized_segments` method to iterate over the normalized
version of the path where dot segments (`.` and `..`) are removed.
In addition, it is possible to push or pop segments to a path using the
corresponding methods:
```rust
let mut iri = IriBuf::new("https://rust-lang.org/a/c".to_string())?;
let mut path = iri.path_mut();

path.pop();
path.push("b".try_into()?);
path.push("c".try_into()?);
path.push("".try_into()?); // the empty segment is valid.

assert_eq!(iri.path(), "/a/b/c/");
```

#### IRI references

This crate provides the two types `IriRef` and `IriRefBuf` to represent
IRI references. An IRI reference is either an IRI or a relative IRI.
Contrarily to regular IRIs, relative IRI references may have no scheme.

```rust
let mut iri_ref = IriRefBuf::default(); // an IRI reference can be empty.

// An IRI reference with a scheme is a valid IRI.
iri_ref.set_scheme(Some("https".try_into()?));
let iri: &Iri = iri_ref.as_iri().unwrap();

// An IRI can be safely converted into an IRI reference.
let iri_ref: &IriRef = iri.into();
```

Given a base IRI, references can be resolved into a regular IRI using the
[Reference Resolution Algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5)
defined in [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).
This crate provides a *strict* implementation of this algorithm.

```rust
let base_iri = Iri::new("http://a/b/c/d;p?q")?;
let mut iri_ref = IriRefBuf::new("g;x=1/../y".to_string())?;

// non mutating resolution.
assert_eq!(iri_ref.resolved(base_iri), "http://a/b/c/y");

// in-place resolution.
iri_ref.resolve(base_iri);
assert_eq!(iri_ref, "http://a/b/c/y");
```

This crate implements
[Errata 4547](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid4547) about the
abnormal use of dot segments in relative paths.
This means that for instance, the path `a/b/../../../` is normalized into
`../`.

#### IRI comparison

Here are the features of the IRI comparison method implemented in this crate.

##### Protocol agnostic

This implementation does not know anything about existing protocols.
For instance, even if the
[HTTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
defines `80` as the default port,
the two IRIs `http://example.org` and `http://example.org:80` are **not** equivalent.

##### Every `/` counts

The path `/foo/bar` is **not** equivalent to `/foo/bar/`.

##### Path normalization

Paths are normalized during comparison by removing dot segments (`.` and `..`).
This means for instance that the paths `a/b/c` and `a/../a/./b/../b/c` **are**
equivalent.
Note however that this crate implements
[Errata 4547](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid4547) about the
abnormal use of dot segments in relative paths.
This means that for instance, the IRI `http:a/b/../../../` is equivalent to
`http:../` and **not** `http:`.

##### Percent-encoded characters

Thanks to the [`pct-str` crate](https://crates.io/crates/pct-str),
percent encoded characters are correctly handled.
The two IRIs `http://example.org` and `http://exa%6dple.org` **are** equivalent.

<!-- cargo-rdme end -->

## What is missing

For now, this crate lacks of a proper way to compare strings in a case
insensitive manner. As a result, the IRIs `http://example.org` and
`htTp://ExAmpLe.Org` that should be equivalent are not.

## What's next?

I am waiting for [Custom DSTs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2594) to
be available in order to
turn the types `Iri` and `IriRef` (and `Path`, `Authority`, etc.) into
dynamically sized types just like `str`, `OsStr`, etc.
This would allow buffered types (`IriBuf`, `PathBuf`, etc.) to `Deref` into
those DSTs and be far more easy to use while simplifying the API.

We just need to wait...
